# aelis
 personal sleep tracker

I was laying in bed and couldn't sleep, so I came up with the idea of making my own sleep tracker.

It isn't anything crazy or impressive, just a simple utility for myself as an exercise to practice programming a bit and get a better idea how I can sleep more efficiently.

The script asks you a series of questions, and records your inputs to a corresponding "aelis-log.csv" file (which can be found in the same directory as the .exe). I wanted it to work this way so that I could easily graph the results in Libreoffice Calc.

This is intended for my own use, but you're free to do anything you'd like with this code or file.
